## MS2 Iteration 2 Velocity Calculation
How many hours we're willing to put aside:
= (12 + 20 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10) = 72
(ethan keren yoav evelyn vushie sunwoo) = team

Our velocity during the first iteration:
hours of estimated work / velocity = work hours required
(evelyn vushie keren yoav ethan sunwoo) = team
(11.5 + 11.5 + 9 + 14 + 16 + 5) / v = 8
v = 8 / 67
v = 0.12

Total time available (after velocity): 72*0.12 = 8.64
Stories slotted for next iteration: US5

## MS1 Iteration 2 - Velocity Calculation 
How many hours we're willing to put aside:
10+8+8+8+20+10 = 64

Our velocity during the first iteration:
hours of estimated work / velocity = work hours required
5 / velocity = 20
velocity = 0.25

Total time available: 16 hours.
